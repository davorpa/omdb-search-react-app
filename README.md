# OMDB Search React App

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

---

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Vite Project](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) configured with a **React SWC** template:

```shell
npm create vite@latest omdb-search-react-app --template react-swc
```

## Available Scripts

In a project where Vite is installed, you can use the `vite` binary in your `npm` scripts, or run it directly with `npx vite`. Here are the default npm scripts in a scaffolded Vite project:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html) for more information.

### `npm run preview`

Locally preview production build.

Once you've built the app, you may test it locally by running `npm run preview` command.

The `vite preview` command will boot up a local static web server that serves the files from `dist` at [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173). It's an easy way to check if the production build looks OK in your local environment.
